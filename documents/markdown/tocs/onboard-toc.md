### Onboarding Service

Use the Onboarding Service to onboard metadata **assets** to an OPP
repository and receive back Hub Keys. The API supports one-off and
batch uploads, and CSV and JSON data formats.

A Hub Key is returned for each successfully onboarded asset.

The Onboarding service API requires authentication, see
[How to authenticate with Open Permissions Platform services](https://github.com/openpermissions/auth-srv/blob/master/documents/markdown/how-to-auth.md).
